	Q: How do I start the server?
A: Right click the Start.ps1 file and Open with Powershell. 
	Q: How do I join my server?
A: 1) Install the modpack using a modded launcher (Curseforge, GDLauncher, ATLauncher, etc)	2) go to the Multiplayer tab in the main menu	3) click Direct Connect and type localhost
	Q: How do others join my server?
A: They will connect using your Public IP Address, which can be found by typing "my ip address" into Google. If people are unable to join with this IP, find a portforwarding guide online.
	Q: How do I allocate more RAM?
A: 1) Double click the start.ps1 instead of opening with Powershell	2) Find the line that says "# -Xmx4G`n" +	3) Delete the # and change the "4" to a number of your choice.
	Q: Should I be worried about errors in the console?
A: Unless there is something that is not working as expected, don't mind any errors. 99% of them mean nothing.
	Q: When I open Powershell, it closes immediately! (This can also solve other issues!)
A: This is likely an issue with Powershell itself. Here is an alternative method of opening the start.ps1:
1) Press the Windows key, type Powershell and run as Administrator
2) Run the following: set-executionpolicy remotesigned
3) Agree by typing A
4) Put the serverpack somewhere on your desktop, remove any spaces
5) Copy the file path
6) Run the following in Powershell: cd (path here)
7) Run the following in Powershell: .\start.ps1
